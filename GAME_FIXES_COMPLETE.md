## Testing the Fixed Blackjack Game

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Network Error on Deal Cards** - Fixed AJAX request handling
2. **Cards Not Appearing** - Replaced `location.reload()` with dynamic UI updates  
3. **Missing Action Buttons** - Added proper dynamic action button creation
4. **Game State Updates** - Implemented real-time UI updates without page refresh

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. JavaScript Functions Updated:
- `gameAction()` - Now calls `updateGameUI()` instead of `location.reload()`
- `newGame()` - Better error handling and state management
- `updateGameUI()` - New function to handle dynamic UI updates
- `updateDealerHand()` - Properly updates dealer cards and score
- `updatePlayerHands()` - Updates all player hands dynamically
- `updateActionButtons()` - Creates action buttons based on game state
- `updateGameSections()` - Switches between betting/game/results sections
- `handleBetFormSubmit()` - Handles betting form via AJAX

#### 2. Improved Game Flow:
- Betting form submission via AJAX
- Dynamic action button creation/removal
- Real-time card updates
- Proper game state transitions
- Shoe penetration updates

#### 3. Better Error Handling:
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages
- Network error recovery

### Testing Steps:
1. Open http://localhost:8002
2. Log in or register
3. Place a bet and click "Deal Cards"
4. Verify cards appear immediately without page refresh
5. Check that action buttons appear (Hit, Stand, etc.)
6. Play through a complete hand
7. Verify shoe penetration updates in real-time
8. Test new game functionality

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Cards deal immediately when clicking "Deal Cards"
- ✅ Action buttons appear after cards are dealt
- ✅ Game updates dynamically during play
- ✅ Shoe penetration percentage updates in real-time
- ✅ No more network errors or page refreshes needed
- ✅ Smooth transition between game phases

The game should now work seamlessly with real-time updates and proper AJAX functionality!
